## How to use



&lt;div class=&quot;tabs-box&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}
```python

from sparknlp.pretrained import PretrainedPipeline

ner_pipeline = PretrainedPipeline(&quot;ner_ade_clinical_langtest_pipeline&quot;, &quot;en&quot;, &quot;clinical/models&quot;)

result = ner_pipeline.annotate(&quot;&quot;&quot;I asked my doctor what could have caused this, and he said it was probably from the Lipitor. Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back. The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep. I had just gotten over a urinary tract infection (one of the side-effects) and I thought it had returned, but the symptoms were different. I still had the urge to urinate constantly, but it would come and go, and I would have no symptoms for a day, then it would return again. I remembered reading the pamphlet that comes with the prescription drugs, and it mentioning some of the symptoms that I was experiencing. I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day, and I did not have any more stomach pain or urgency. I also had been experiencing lack of energy for quite some time, and I attributed this to stress, but after reading this website, I feel it was due to the Lipitor also. I don't think I will take this drug anymore, and since I read that taking vitamin C can help you with your cholesterol, I think I will try this method instead. I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects. I don't want to be a case-study when they finally take this drug off the market.&quot;&quot;&quot;)

Additionally, there is no side effect observed after Influenza vaccine. One day ago, mom also noticed a tactile temperature and gave the patient Tylenol. Baby also has had some decreased p.o. intake. His normal breast-feeding is down from 20 minutes q.2h. to 5 to 10 minutes secondary to his respiratory congestion. He sleeps well, but has been more tired and has been fussy over the past 2 days. The parents noticed no improvement with albuterol treatments given in the ER. His urine output has also decreased; normally he has 8 to 10 wet and 5 dirty diapers per 24 hours, now he has down to 4 wet diapers per 24 hours. Mom denies any diarrhea. His bowel movements are yellow colored and soft in nature.&quot;&quot;&quot;)

## How to use



&lt;div class=&quot;tabs-box&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}
```python

from sparknlp.pretrained import PretrainedPipeline

ner_pipeline = PretrainedPipeline(&quot;ner_ade_clinical_langtest_pipeline&quot;, &quot;en&quot;, &quot;clinical/models&quot;)

result = ner_pipeline.annotate(&quot;&quot;&quot;I asked my doctor what could have caused this, and he said it was probably from the Lipitor. Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back. The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep. I had just gotten over a urinary tract infection (one of the side-effects) and I thought it had returned, but the symptoms were different. I still had the urge to urinate constantly, but it would come and go, and I would have no symptoms for a day, then it would return again. I remembered reading the pamphlet that comes with the prescription drugs, and it mentioning some of the symptoms that I was experiencing. I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day, and I did not have any more stomach pain or urgency. I also had been experiencing lack of energy for quite some time, and I attributed this to stress, but after reading this website, I feel it was due to the Lipitor also. I don't think I will take this drug anymore, and since I read that taking vitamin C can help you with your cholesterol, I think I will try this method instead. I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects. I don't want to be a case-study when they finally take this drug off the market.&quot;&quot;&quot;)
